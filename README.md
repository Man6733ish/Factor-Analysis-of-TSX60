# Factor Analysis of Canadian Blue Chip Stocks (TSX60)

# Motivation

What could be a perfect way to utilize unfortunate lockdown period? Like most of you, I spend my time in cooking, Netflix, coding and reading some latest research papers on weekends. The idea of Factor Analysis struck to me when I was browsing through some research papers. I couldn't find any relevant research paper related to factor Analysis in finance (and of course dataset!) associated with it.
